#+TITLE: Undo-hl

Sometimes in a long undo chain where Emacs jumps to a far away
position, I can’t tell whether the undo operation just moved to this
position or it has also deleted some text. This package is meant to
alleviate that confusion: it flashes the to-be-deleted text before
deleting so I know what is happening.

This package is pretty efficient, I can hold down undo button and the highlight doesn’t slow down the operation.

Watch [[https://youtu.be/enoGj4C5jzI][demo on YouTube]].

This is different from =highlight-changes-mode= in several regards. It highlights to-be-deleted text before deleting rather than after. Marking the deleted text after it’s deleted isn’t very helpful in my situation. It also has less functionalities than =highlight-changes-mode=, but I’m quite happy with the single function it now has.

* Usage

Download and install the package, then =M-x undo-hl-mode RET=. This is a local minor mode so you need to add to other mode’s hooks. I recommend only enabling this for text-editing modes.

* Customization
- Face: =undo-hl-delete=
- Face: =undo-hl-insert=
- Option: =undo-hl-undo-commands=. Undo-hl only runs before and after undo commands, if you use non-default undo commands, add them to this list.
- Option: =undo-hl-flash-duration=. "Undo-hl flashes the to-be-deleted text for this number of seconds. Note that insertion highlight is not affected by this option: the highlight is removed when next command is called, not after a timer.
