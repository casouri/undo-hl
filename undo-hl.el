;;; undo-hl.el --- Highlight undo/redo  -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; Author: Yuan Fu <casouri@gmail.com>
;; URL: https://github.com/casouri/undo-hl
;; Version: 1.0
;; Keywords: undo
;; Package-Requires: ((emacs "26.0"))

;;; This file is NOT part of GNU Emacs

;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Sometimes in a long undo chain where Emacs jumps to a position, I
;; can’t tell whether the undo operation just moved to this position
;; or it has also deleted some text. This package is meant to
;; alleviate that confusion: it flashes the to-be-deleted text before
;; deleting so I know what is happening.
;;
;; This package is pretty efficient, I can hold down undo button and
;; the highlight doesn’t slow down the operation.
;;

;;; Code:
;;
;; I tried to use pulse.el but it wasn’t fast enough (eg, when holding
;; down C-.), so I used a more economical implementation. Instead of a
;; flash, the highlight will persist until the next command.
