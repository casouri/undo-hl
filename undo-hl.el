;;; undo-hl.el --- Highlight undo/redo  -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; Author: Yuan Fu <casouri@gmail.com>
;; URL: https://github.com/casouri/undo-hl
;; Version: 1.0
;; Keywords: undo
;; Package-Requires: ((emacs "26.0"))

;;; This file is NOT part of GNU Emacs

;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Sometimes in a long undo chain where Emacs jumps to a position, I
;; can’t tell whether the undo operation just moved to this position
;; or it has also deleted some text. This package is meant to
;; alleviate that confusion: it flashes the to-be-deleted text before
;; deleting so I know what is happening.
;;
;; This package is pretty efficient, I can hold down undo button and
;; the highlight doesn’t slow down the operation.
;;

;;; Code:
;;
;; I tried to use pulse.el but it wasn’t fast enough (eg, when holding
;; down C-.), so I used a more economical implementation. Instead of a
;; flash, the highlight will persist until the next command.
;;
;; Some package, like aggressive-indent, modifies the buffer when the
;; user makes modifications (in ‘post-command-hook’, timer, etc).
;; Their modification invokes ‘before-change-functions’ just like a
;; user modification. Naturally we don’t want to highlight those
;; automatic modifications made not by the user. How do we do that?
;; Essentially we generate a ticket for each command loop
;; (‘undo-hl--hook-can-run’). One user modification = one command loop
;; = one ticket = one highlight. Whoever runs first gets to use that
;; ticket, and all other subsequent invocation of
;; `undo-hl--before-change’ must not do anything. We only constraint
;; the before hooks, ie, deletion highlight because deletion highlight
;; is blocking, while insertion highlight is not. Consecutive
;; insertion highlight only shows the last one, but consecutive
;; deletion highlight will show every highlight for
;; ‘undo-hl-flash-duration’ and can be very annoying.

  ;; How does text property change obstruct highlighting the real
  ;; edit: First, we only highlight one change every command loop;
  ;; second, a single undo could make multiple changes, including
  ;; moving point, changing text property, inserting/deleting text.
  ;; Both text prop change and ins/del invokes
  ;; ‘after/before-change-functions’, so if there is a text prop edit
  ;; before the real text edit in the undo history, undo-hl will
  ;; highlight the text prop change (often of size 1 at EOL) and
  ;; ignore the following text change. A simple check of size
  ;; eliminates most of such problems caused by both jit-lock and
  ;; ws-bulter.
